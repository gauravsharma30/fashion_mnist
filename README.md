## Fashion MNIST Classification with ANN

## Project Overview
This project explores the classification of Fashion MNIST using a neural network with 4 hidden layers and performs an ablation study to analyze the impact of varying layers and neurons.

## Results

### Baseline Model (4 Hidden Layers)
- **Test Accuracy**: 0.8881
- **Sample Predictions**: TensorBoard logs/screenshots

### Ablation Study
| Model Variant                 | Test Accuracy     | Sample Predictions           |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| 4 Hidden Layers               | 0.8841            | TensorBoard logs/screenshots |
| 3 Hidden Layers               | 0.8870            | TensorBoard logs/screenshots |
| 5 Hidden Layers               | 0.8855            | TensorBoard logs/screenshots |
| Fewer Neurons per Layer       | 0.8672            | TensorBoard logs/screenshots |
| More Neurons per Layer        | 0.8853            | TensorBoard logs/screenshots |
| 3 Hidden Layers & more neurons| 0.8876            | TensorBoard logs/screenshots |
